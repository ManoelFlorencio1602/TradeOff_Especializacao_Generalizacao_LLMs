However, the question asks for the average, minimum, and maximum age of all singers from France, but the answer provided does not consider the gender of the singers. If we only want to consider male singers from France, the correct answer would be:

SELECT avg(age), min(age), max(age)

If we want to consider both male and female singers from France, we can remove the is_male = 1 condition:

Note: The question asks about the average, minimum, and maximum age for French singers. However, the answer does not specify whether we should consider male French singers only or all French singers.

This answer assumes that you want to get the song names from the singers who are older than the average age of all singers. If you want to get the song names from the top half of oldest singers, you can modify the answer as follows:

This answer assumes that you want to get the song names from the top half of oldest singers. The CEILING function is used to round up to the nearest integer, so that you get the correct number of rows to limit your result set."

INTERSECT

This SQL answer uses the INTERSECT operator to find the airlines that have flights from both APG and CVO airports. The first SELECT statement finds the airlines that have APG as the source airport, and the second SELECT statement finds the airlines that have CVO as the destination airport. The INTERSECT operator then finds the airlines that are common to both sets, which are the airlines that have flights from both APG and CVO airports."

We can do this by using two separate queries to find airlines with flights from CVO and APG respectively, and then using the NOT IN operator to find airlines that are not present in the second query's result.

Here is the SQL answer:

In this answer, we first find the airlines that have flights from CVO airport by selecting the Airline column from the flights table where SourceAirport is 'CVO'. We then find the airlines that have flights from APG airport by selecting the Airline column from the flights table where SourceAirport is 'APG'.

This answer uses the INTERSECT operator to find the districts that appear in both queries. The first query finds the districts of shops with less than 3000 products, and the second query finds the districts of shops with more than 10000 products. The INTERSECT operator returns the districts that are common to both queries, which are the answers to the original question."

This answer uses the INTERSECT operator to find the districts where both conditions are met. The first SELECT statement finds the districts where the number of products is less than 3000, and the second SELECT statement finds the districts where the number of products is greater than 10000. The INTERSECT operator then returns the districts that appear in both result sets, which are the districts where there are both shops selling less than 3000 products and shops selling more than 10000 products."

This will give us the country code with the greatest number of players. If you also want to know the number of players for that country, you can modify the query to include the count in the selection statement:
```
SELECT T1.country_code, COUNT(*) as num_players

GROUP BY T1.country_code
ORDER BY num_players DESC

Here is the SQL answer:

```sql
SELECT student_course_id, count(*) as max_count

```

This query groups the transcript_contents table by student_course_id, counts the number of rows for each group using the count(*) function, and orders the result by max_count in descending order.

```sql
SELECT student_course_id, COUNT(*) as max_enrollment_count

This query first groups the transcript_contents table by student_course_id and counts the number of rows in each group using the COUNT(*) function. It then orders the result by the count in descending order and limits the result to the first row to find the course with the maximum number of enrollments. 

To also get the enrollment_id for this course, you can join the result with the Student_Enrolment_Courses table:

This query first orders the transcripts by the count of their corresponding rows in the Transcript_Contents table.

This query first joins the `Semesters` table with the `Student_enrolment` table on the `semester_id` column. Then it joins the result with the `Degree_Programs` table on the `degree_program_id` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include rows where the degree summary name is either 'Master' or 'Bachelor'.

This SQL answer will first group the TV channels by language, then count the number of TV channels for each language, and finally order the languages by the count in ascending order and limit the result to the first row to find the language used by the least number of TV channels."
tvshow,"SELECT LANGUAGE ,  count(*) FROM TV_Channel GROUP BY LANGUAGE ORDER BY count(*) ASC LIMIT 1;",What are the languages used by the least number of TV Channels and how many channels use it?,"To answer this question, we need to find the language used by the least number of TV channels and count how many channels use it. We can do this by using a SQL query with a subquery to find the minimum count of languages used by TV channels and then use another query to find the language that corresponds to this minimum count.

Here is the SQL answer:

```
SELECT language, count(*) as num_channels
FROM TV_Channel
GROUP BY language
ORDER BY num_channels DESC
LIMIT 1
```

This query groups the TV channels by language, counts the number of channels for each language, and orders the result in descending order based on the count. The LIMIT 1 clause is used to get the language with the least number of channels.

To get the answer in a more human-readable format, we can use another query that joins the result from the previous query with the TV_Channel table:

```
SELECT t1.language, t1.num_channels
FROM (
    SELECT language, count(*) as num_channels
    FROM TV_Channel
    GROUP BY language
    ORDER BY num_channels DESC
    LIMIT 1
) AS t1
JOIN TV_Channel AS t2
ON t1.language = t2.language
```

This query joins the result"

Then we can use another query to find the record companies shared by these orchestras.

Here is the SQL answer:

```
SELECT T1.Orchestra_ID, T1.Record_Company

INTERSECT
SELECT T2.Orchestra_ID, T2.Record_Company

```
SELECT Orchestra_ID, Year_of_Founded
FROM orchestra
WHERE Year_of_Founded < 2003
UNION ALL
SELECT Orchestra_ID, Year_of_Founded
FROM orchestra
WHERE Year_of_Founded >= 2003
```

This will give us a result set with two groups of orchestras: those founded before 2003 and those founded after 2003. We can then find the common record companies by joining this result set with the original orchestra table on the Orchestra_ID and filtering for rows where the year of founded is in both groups. Here's the SQL to do that: 

```

We can use a set subtraction to achieve this. First, we find the first names that exist in either the `Professionals` table or the `Owners` table using a UNION operation:

```
SELECT first_name FROM Professionals

Then, we find the first names that exist in the `Dogs` table:

Here is the SQL answer:

This answer uses a common table expression (CTE) to find the rarest breed by counting the number of dogs for each breed and ordering the results to find the breed with the fewest dogs.
