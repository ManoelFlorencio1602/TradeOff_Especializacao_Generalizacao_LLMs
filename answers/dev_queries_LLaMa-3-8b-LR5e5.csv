We can do this by selecting the horsepower from the cars_data table and finding the minimum value. Let's assume the lowest horsepower is x.

Then we select the makes and make names from the cars_data table where the horsepower is greater than x. Let's assume the result is table A.

Next, we select the makes and make names from the cars_data table where the number of cylinders is more than 3. Let's assume the result is table B.

We can use the ROW_NUMBER() function to rank the breeds by their frequency of appearance in descending order, and then select the top row to find the rarest breed.

After finding the rarest breed, we can use a JOIN to find the dogs of that breed and their corresponding treatment dates.
