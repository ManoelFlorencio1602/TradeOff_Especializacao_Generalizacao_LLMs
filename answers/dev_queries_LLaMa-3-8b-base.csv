This query first finds the makers that produce at least 2 models by joining the `model_list` table with a subquery that groups the makers by the count of models they produce. Then it joins this result with the `car_makers` table to get the ids of these makers. Finally, it joins this result with another subquery that groups the makers by the total count of cars they produce, and filters out the makers that produce less than 4 cars. The result is the ids and makers of all car makers that produce at least 2 models and make more than 3 cars."

First, we need to find the players who are from the country with code USA. We can do this by joining the `players` table with the `matches` table and filtering the results to only include players from USA.

Assuming the `players` table has a column `ioc` representing the country code, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT p.name, p.dob
FROM players p
JOIN matches m ON p.player_id = m.loser_id OR p.player_id = m.winner_id
WHERE m.tourney_ioc = 'USA';
```

This query joins the `players` table with the `matches` table on the `player_id` column, and then filters the results to only include players who are from the country with code USA. The `name` and `dob` columns are selected from the `players` table.

Please note that this query assumes that the `ioc` column in the `players` table represents the country code, and the `tourney_ioc` column in the `matches` table represents the country code of the tournament. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the query"

This will give us the average age of all dogs.

Next, we need to count the number of dogs that have an age below this average. We can do this by using a subquery:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)

```"
dog_kennels,SELECT count(*) FROM Dogs WHERE age  <  ( SELECT avg(age) FROM Dogs ),Count the number of dogs of an age below the average.,"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average age of the dogs. Then, we can count the number of dogs with an age below the average.

Here is the SQL query to calculate the average age of the dogs:

```sql
SELECT AVG(CAST(age AS DECIMAL(5,2))) AS average_age
FROM Dogs
```

This query casts the age from VARCHAR to DECIMAL(5,2) to allow for decimal calculations.

Now, we can use this average age to count the number of dogs with an age below the average:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Dogs
WHERE CAST(age AS DECIMAL(5,2)) < (SELECT AVG(CAST(age AS DECIMAL(5,2))) FROM Dogs)
```

This query casts the age from VARCHAR to DECIMAL(5,2) to allow for decimal comparisons. It then counts the number of rows where the age is less than the average age.

So, the final SQL answer is:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Dogs
WHERE CAST(age AS DECIMAL(5,2)) < (SELECT AVG(CAST(age AS DECIMAL(5,2))) FROM Dogs)
