Unfortunately, the schema is not provided. Please provide the CREATE TABLE statements for the tables involved.

Assuming that the schema includes a table called ""student"" with columns ""stu_num"", ""stu_lname"", ""stu_fname"", ""stu_init"", ""stu_dob"", ""stu_hrs"", ""stu_class"", ""stu_gpa"", and ""stu_transfer"", we can answer the question as follows:

```
SELECT stu_class, COUNT(*) AS num_students

GROUP BY stu_class
ORDER BY num_students DESC;
```

This SQL query groups the students by their class (assuming it represents the grade level), counts the number of students in each class, and orders the result in descending order. The WHERE clause filters the students to only include those who are high schoolers (born between 1999 and 2002)."

network_1,SELECT grade FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1,Which grade has the most high schoolers?,"To answer this question, we need to join the ""high_schooler"" table with the ""grade"" table. Since there is no ""high_schooler"" table in the provided schema, we assume that the ""grade"" table contains information about the students' grades. 

However, the problem statement does not provide any information about the ""grade"" table. We can only make an assumption that the ""grade"" table contains a column for the grade level (e.g., 9, 10, 11, 12). 

Assuming that the ""grade"" table contains a column named ""grade_level"", we can write the SQL query as follows:

```
SELECT grade_level, COUNT(*)

This query will return the grade level with the most students."
network_1,SELECT grade FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1,Return the grade that has the greatest number of high schoolers.,"To answer this question, we need to join the tables that contain information about high schoolers and grades. Since we don't have a table that directly contains the information about high schoolers, we can assume that the ""head"" table contains the information about the heads of the departments, and the ""management"" table contains the information about the heads of the departments and their corresponding departments. We can then join these tables with the ""department"" table to get the information about the departments.

Here's the SQL query that answers the question:

We can do this by joining the ENROLL and STUDENT tables, and then filtering out the students who have friends.

Here is the SQL query to find the students who do not have any friends:

```
SELECT S.STU_LNAME, S.STU_FNAME, E.ENROLL_GRADE

LEFT JOIN ENROLL E ON S.STU_NUM = E.STU_NUM
WHERE E.STU_NUM IS NULL;

This query will return the last name, first name, and grade of the students who do not have any friends.

To find the lowest grade of these students, we can use the MIN function:

```
SELECT MIN(E.ENROLL_GRADE)
FROM STUDENT S
LEFT JOIN ENROLL E ON S.STU_NUM = E.STU_NUM
WHERE E.STU_NUM IS NULL;
```

However, this query will return the lowest grade of all students, not just the ones who do not have any friends.

To fix this, we can combine the two queries into one:

LEFT JOIN ENROLL E ON S.STU_NUM = E.ST"

Here is the SQL query to find the average age:

```sql
SELECT AVG(CAST(age AS DECIMAL(10,2))) AS average_age

This query will give us the average age of the dogs. Now, we can use this average age to find the number of dogs with an age below the average. We can do this by using the COUNT function in SQL with a WHERE clause.

Here is the SQL query to find the number of dogs with an age below the average:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Dogs
WHERE CAST(age AS DECIMAL(10,2)) < (SELECT AVG(CAST(age AS DECIMAL(10,2))) FROM Dogs);
```

This query will give us the number of dogs with an age below the average. 

So, the final SQL answer is:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)

WHERE CAST(age AS DECIMAL(10,2)) < (SELECT AVG(CAST(age AS DECIMAL(10,2))) FROM Dogs);

dog_kennels,SELECT count(*) FROM Dogs WHERE age  <  ( SELECT avg(age) FROM Dogs ),Count the number of dogs of an age below the average.,"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the average age of the dogs. Then, we can count the number of dogs with an age below the average.
